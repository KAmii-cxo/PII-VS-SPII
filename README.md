# PII vs SPII

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** and **SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information)** are both categories of data related to individuals, but they differ in terms of sensitivity.

## PII (Personally Identifiable Information)
This refers to any information that can be used to identify an individual, either directly or indirectly. PII includes a broad range of data, such as:
- Name
- Address
- Phone number
- Email address
- Social security number (in some cases, could be considered SPII)
- Birthdate

PII on its own does not always require heightened protection unless combined with other data that could potentially lead to identity theft or fraud.

## SPII (Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information)
This is a subset of PII and refers to more sensitive data that, if exposed, could cause significant harm to an individual. SPII requires stronger protections due to the higher risks associated with its exposure. Examples include:
- Social Security Number (SSN)
- Passport numbers
- Driverâ€™s license number
- Financial account details (bank account numbers, credit card numbers)
- Medical or health information
- Biometric data (fingerprints, facial recognition)
- Authentication information (passwords, security questions)

SPII typically requires more stringent safeguards because of the potential consequences of identity theft, fraud, or personal harm if the information is compromised.
